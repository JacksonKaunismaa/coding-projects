<text>What is the result of adding the vectors [3,-1] and [4,2] (place an arrow)</text><add=1><visible=f><ihat>1,0</ihat><jhat>0,1</jhat><visible=t><type=vectors><reveal>In vector addition, simply add up each component elementwise, so [3,-1] + [4,2] becomes 2 sub-problems, adding 3 + 4 and -1 + 2, which gives you [7,1]</reveal><answer>7,1</answer>
<text>What is the dot product of the vectors [4, 2] and [-1, 0]?</text><add=1><visible=f><ihat>1,0</ihat><jhat>0,1</jhat><visible=t><type=text><reveal>Remember that dot products involving doing pairwise multiplication and then summing all the results, so the answer is 4 * -1 + 2 * 0 = -4</reveal><answer>-4</answer>
<text>What is the result of 3 * [1/2, 2/3] (place a vector on the grid to show your answer)</text><add=1><visible=f><ihat>1,0</ihat><jhat>0,1</jhat><visible=t><type=vectors><reveal>Vector-scalar multiplication is just take each element of the vector and multiply it by the scalar to get the answer so you get [1/2 * 3, 2/3 * 3] = [1.5, 2]</reveal><answer>1.5,2</answer>
<text>What it the result of adding the red ane blue vectors (place answer on the grid)?</text><add=1><visible=f><ihat>1,0</ihat><jhat>0,1</jhat><visible=t><vector>(2.5,-1,R,0);;(-1,-1,B,1)<type=vectors>In vector addition, simply add up each component elementwise, or in this case, you can just visually imagine the vectors moving around to line up and "add together"<reveal></reveal><answer>1.5,-2</answer>
<text>What it the result of doing blue - green vector (place answer on the grid)?</text><add=1><visible=f><ihat>1,0</ihat><jhat>0,1</jhat><visible=t><vector>(5,0,B,0);;(2,0,G,1)<type=vectors>In vector addition, simply add up each component elementwise, or in this case, you can just visually imagine the vectors moving around to line up and "add together", just making sure you account for the fact that you have to scale the green vector by -1 before adding<reveal></reveal><answer>3,0</answer>
