<text>Let's begin to look at some of the things you can do with vectors, starting with addition</text>
<text>Let's say we have a vector like [-1, 3] (red), and a vector like [2, -4] (yellow), and we want to add the two.</text><vector>(-1,3,R,0)...(2,-4,Y,1)</vector>
<text>If you interpret a vector as kind of a "direction" or "force" or "velocity" that pushes a point along, addition becomes easy. The vectors you've seen up to this point all have a "tail" starting at the origin, but we can imagine that vectors can start from elsewhere, say from (-5,-2)</text><animate>(1.trans(-5,-2))</animate>
<text>When you line up the tail and head of the vectors you are adding, the final point to which it points is the result. In this case, it is then easy to see that [-1, 3] + [2, -4] = [1, -1] or [2, -2] + [-5, -1] = [-3, -3] (green)</text><animate>(1.trans(4,5))</animate><vector>(2,-2,G,999),(-5,-1,G,1000+(2,-2,1001))</vector>
<text>You may have noticed a pattern in these two examples: to add two vectors like [a, b] and [c, d], all you have to do is simply add the components individually, so you'd get [a+c, b+d]</text><vector>(-1,3,R,8),(2,-4,Y,9+(-1,3,125))</vector><remove>999,1000,1001</remove>
<text>Visualize what happens if you did that opposite in the previous example: what if you started at [3, 4], then moved [-1, 3] units. Where do you end up? Is it the same as if you did it the other way? What does this imply about the relationship between a + b and b + a, for vectors a and b?</text><animate>(1.trans(1,-3)),(0.trans(2,-4))</animate>
<text>In this way, we can see the two ways to view adding vectors: as tips and tails lining up to get "pushed" along one direction, then from there into another; algebraically adding up the elements of a vector component-wise</text>
<text>Another thing you can do with vectors is scale them, and change their magnitude. The magnitude is essentially the length of the vector - for example, the magnitude of the vector [3, 4] (yellow) is 5, using the Pythagorean theorem</text><vector>(3,4,Y,2)</vector><remove>0,1,9,125,8</remove>
<text>If we want to change the magnitude of a vector, increasing/decreasing its length in the same direction, we simply multiply each component of the vector by a single number. So if we want to double the length of a vector, we'd multiply each component by 2</text><animate>(2.scale(2))</animate>
<text>We can extend this concept to negative numbers, too: if you multiply a vector by say -1.6, the negative means "reverse the direction your vector is pointing" and the 1.6 means "then multiply the length by 1.6" (see blue)</text><vector>(2,4,B,6)</vector><animate>(6.scale(-2))</animate><remove>2</remove>
<text>We can scale a vector in any direction along this 'ray' that it creates, but no matter what number you multiply by, the vector will always have to remain on that line.</text><vector>(-2,-2,B,3),(2,2,B,4),(-4,-4,B,5);;;(500,500,B,-123);;;;;(5,5,B,-124)</vector><animate>(-123.scale(2.5));;(-124.scale(-2.1)),(3.scale(-1)),(4.scale(-2.43)),(5.scale(12))</animate><remove>0,1,6</remove>
<text>As a quick numerical example, let's say we want to multiply the length/magnitude of the vector [3, 1.5] (blue) by 3 - in other words, we want to triple the magnitude; we can imagine this vector "growing" in the same direction up to 3x its size, or we can multiply each component by 3 to get the answer [9, 4.5]</text><vector>(3,1.5,B,7)</vector><animate>(7.scale(3))</animate><remove>3,4,5,-123,-124</remove>
<text>Combining the ideas of adding and scaling vectors, subtraction becomes easy. The key idea is to think of subtracting two vectors a and b (we want a - b) as instead a + (-1 * b)</text>
<text>If you think about distributive property, it's clear right away that these two questions are the same, but the second is easier to interpret</text>
<text>a + (-1 * b) asks, "Starting from the tip of vector a, reverse the direction that b points in, then follow that direction to get the answer"</text>
<text>You can also think of it as solving an equation like a - b = c. You rearrange to get a = b + c, and then you get a nice triangular picture, and the question then becomes "what is the missing side, c?"</text>
<text>And of course the same component-wise method works too: if want to do [2, 6] - [3, -1] simply subtract 2 - 3 and 6 - (-1) to get the vector [-1, 7]</text>
<text>Try to think of how that previous example would look in the other two views as well. Visualize what it looks like to start at the point/vector [2, 6], and then travel "backwards" by [3, -1]. Where would you end up? Also try to imagine the missing side of the triangle that you are trying to find</text>
<text>In summary, we've seen how to add, subtract, and scale vectors, and what that means visually/geometrically. Adding vectors is like lining them up so that the tail of one vector originates from the head of another. Scaling is like a vector "growing" or "contracting" in the same direction it points</text>
<text>Subtraction is a combination of these two ideas, where you convert the problem a - b into a + (-1 * b) a scaling, then addition</text>
<text>Make sure you really understand everything that is going on here fully before moving on. Ask yourself questions like "what happens visually if I add 3 or 4 vectors together?" or "what if I scale by weird numbers like 0 or -1?" and more.</text>
