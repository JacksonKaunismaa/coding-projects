<text>Linear transformations</text><visible=t><transform=t><ihat>1,0</ihat><jhat>0,1</jhat>
<text>Linear transformations are essentially a mapping, a function in R2 that maps vectors from one point to another (just ignore the panel on the left for now, we'll get to that later</text>
<text>You can see here that we've defined our grid based on the positions of our 2 basis vectors in green (called "i hat") and red (called "j hat")</text>
<text>These vectors are at unit distance from the origin, and perpendicular to each other, and by adding and summing copies, we get every value on the grid</text>
<text>For example, the point [2, -1] (blue) on the grid can actually be thought of as "take 2 copies of i hat and add them together, then add a negative copy of j hat"</text><vector>(1,0,G,0),(0,-1,R,2)),(2,-1,B,1)</vector><animate>(0.trans(1,0)),,(2.trans(2,0))</animate>
<text>However, we've made an assumption here: why do i hat and j hat necessarily be perpendicular to each other and unit distance from the origin?</text>
<text>If we keep our same reinterpretation of the vector [2, -1] as "take 2 copies of i hat and add them together, then add a negative copy of j hat", it makes perfect sense for i hat and j hat to be something else</text>
<text>Let's see what happens if we set i hat (formerly [0, 1]) to [3, 4] and j hat (formerly [1, 0]) to [-2, -1]</text><ihat>3,4</ihat><jhat>-2,-1</jhat>
<text>We can see how space is stretched and squeezed, with grid lines remaining parallel and evenly spaced, with the origin staying fixed (this is a key fact to LINEAR transformations, if this fact were not true, the transformation would not be linear)</text><ihat>1,2</ihat><jhat>3,-1</jhat>
<text>While it may not seem obvious at first, the idea of matrix multiplication is actually equivalent to this idea of visual linear transformations we see here</text><remove>0,1,2</remove>
<text>There is a particular type of matrix (a "grid" of numbers, an extension of vectors which are a single "column of numbers"), called an "identity" matrix (press reset on the left panel to see what it looks like), which is kind of like a "do nothing" linear transformation, like f(x)=x</text><ihat>1,0</ihat><jhat>0,1</jhat>
<text>Pay close attention to the COLUMNS of this matrix. They are [1,0] and [0,1] from left to right, in this identity matrix. Does those vectors, which, as I've claimed somehow represent a "do nothing"/default linear transformation seem familiar?</text>
<text>In fact, these 2 vectors are actually just the values of i hat and j hat that the current linear transformation having been applied to default space take on. Try applying a transformation (using sliders) of [[1,2],[-3,5]]. Pay close attention to where i hat (green) and j hat (red) end up</text>
<text>The place they end up is exactly those points, [1,2] and [-3,5]! So by moving i hat and j hat into the columns of the matrix, changing the columns of that matrix, applying that linear transformation, we see how whatever we change the values of the matrix to are going to be where i hat and j hat end up</text>
<text>Let's take a look at another example, the transformation called a "shear" that can be written as [[1,1],[1,0]]. This says "take your i hat components and and shift them right one unit, but leave your j hat untouched". Look at the effect it has on the blue vector. How do its values change, precisely?</text><vector>(-2,4,B,0)</vector><ihat>1,0</ihat><jhat>1,1</jhat>
<text>Make sure to go over this lesson many times, to make sure you understand how the ideas of moving i hat and j hat (which come from the COLUMNS of the matrix) around on the plane can be a way to interpret what a given matrix/linear transformation will look like</text>
<text>If you can understand that, you will have a very good foundational understanding of linear algebra and will be able to grasp concepts like nullspace, non-rectangular matrices, and the like very easily</text>
