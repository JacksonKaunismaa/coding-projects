# Educational
This was originally a school project to make an educational tool for linear algebra. To build it, install [Bazel](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install.html) (tested with version 0.24.1, but very likely works for other versions), then navigate to the Educational directory and type `bazel build //:Educational`. To actually run it, stay in the same directory and type `bazel-bin/Educational`
