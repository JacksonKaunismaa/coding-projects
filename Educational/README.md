# Educational
This was originally a school project to make an educational tool for linear algebra. To build it, install Bazel (tested with version 0.24.1, but very likely works for other versions), 
then navigate to the Educational directory and type `bazel build //:Educational`. To actually run it, stay in the same directory and type `bazel-bin/Educational`
