<text>Place a vector on the screen at (R(-7,7,0), R(-5,6,1)). (using right click to add a vector, "Reset" to clear any existing vectors, and left click+drag any gray vectors you've added by right click to move them around to the desired location)</text><add=1><visible=f><ihat>1,0</ihat><jhat>0,1</jhat><visible=t><type=vectors><reveal>The correct answer involves (using right click) placing a vector on the grid. You must remember that our grid represents a kind of 2D number line, so you have to get both components in both directions correct</reveal>
